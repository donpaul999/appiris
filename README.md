<h1>APPIRIS - delay graph generator - CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE - the source website is down</h1>
<h3>This is a website for generating a graph based on a train's delays for the last 30 days.</h3>
<h5>More updates to come</h5>
This project is meant to practice web scraping. This is the website where I got the data from https://appiris.infofer.ro (it is a bit of mess for web scraping).
